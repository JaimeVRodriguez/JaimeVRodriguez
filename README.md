### Dedicated professional passionate about designing and building scalable software solutions that would serve thousands of customers.
### I have served in the U.S. Army for the past 11 years. The last 4 of which have been in Special Operations as a Market Research Analyst and Talent Acquisition Specialist. I have served on small collaborative teams in ambiguous missions across the world. As I pursue a career in software development I am looking to combine my passion for programming with my 11 years of military experience in order to serve with a team on the leading edge of technology.
